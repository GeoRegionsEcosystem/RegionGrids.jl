# Rectilinear

The `RectilinearGrid` type can be further subdivided into three different types based on the `GeoRegion` type:
* Mapping rectilinearly-gridded lon-lat data to a `RectRegion` or `PolyRegion` returns a `RLinearMask` type.
* Mapping rectilinearly-gridded lon-lat data to a `TiltRegion` returns a `RLinearTilt` type.
